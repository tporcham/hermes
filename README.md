Hermes provides a set of terminology tools built around SNOMED CT including:

* a fast terminology service with full-text search functionality; ideal for driving autocompletion in user interfaces
* an inference engine in order to analyse SNOMED CT expressions and concepts and derive meaning
* cross-mapping to and from other code systems
* support for SNOMED CT compositional grammar and the SNOMED CT expression constraint language.

It is designed as both library for embedding into larger applications, or as a microservice. 

It is fast, both for import and for use. It imports and indexes the International
and UK editions of SNOMED CT in less than 5 minutes; you can have a server
running seconds after that. 

It replaces previous similar tools I wrote in java and golang and is designed to fit into a wider architecture with identifier resolution, mapping and semantics as first-class abstractions.

Rather than a single monolithic terminology server, it is entirely reasonable to build
multiple services, each providing an API around a specific edition or version of SNOMED CT,
and to use an API gateway to manage client access. `Hermes` is lightweight and designed
to be composed with other services.

It is part of my PatientCare v4 development; previous versions have been operational within NHS Wales
since 2007.

You can have a working terminology server running by typing only a few lines at a terminal. There's no need
for any special hardware, or any special dependencies such as setting up your own elasticsearch or solr cluster.
You just need a filesystem! Many other tools take hours to import the SNOMED data; you'll be finished in less than
10 minutes!

A HL7 FHIR terminology facade is under development : [hades](https://github.com/wardle/hades).
This exposes the functionality available in `hermes` via a FHIR terminology API. This already
supports search and autocompletion using the $expand operation. 

# Quickstart

You can have a terminology server running in minutes.
Full documentation is below, but here is a quickstart. 

1. Install clojure

e.g on Mac OS X
```shell
brew install clojure
```

2. Clone the repository and change directory
```shell
git clone https://github.com/wardle/hermes
cd hermes
```   

3. Download and install one or more distributions 

If you're a UK user and want to use automatic downloads, you can do this

```shell
clj -M:run --db snomed.db download uk.nhs/sct-clinical api-key trud-api-key.txt cache-dir /tmp/trud
clj -M:run --db snomed.db download uk.nhs/sct-drug-ext api-key trud-api-key.txt cache-dir /tmp/trud
```
Ensure you have a [TRUD API key](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud3/user/guest/group/0/home).

This will download both the UK clinical edition and the UK drug extension. If you're a UK user, I'd recommend 
installing both. 

If you've downloaded a distribution manually, import like this:

```shell
clj -M:run --db snomed.db import ~/Downloads/snomed-2021/
```

My tiny i5 'NUC' machine takes 4 minutes to import the UK edition of SNOMED CT and a further 2 minutes to import the UK dictionary
of medicines and devices.

4. Compact and index
```shell
clj -J-Xmx8g -M:run --db snomed.db compact
clj -M:run --db snomed.db index
```

My machine takes 6 seconds to compact the database and 2 minutes to build the search index. 

5. Run a server!
```shell
clj -M:run --db snomed.db --port 8080 serve
```

You can use [hades](https://github.com/wardle/hades) with the 'snomed.db' index
to give you a FHIR terminology server.


# Common questions

### What is the use of `hermes`?

`hermes` provides a simple library, and optionally a microservice, to help
you make use of SNOMED CT.

A library can be embedded into your application; this is easy using Clojure or
Java. You make calls using the API just as you'd use any regular library.

A microservice runs independently and you make use of the data and software
by making an API call over the network. 

Like all `PatientCare` components, you can use `hermes` in either way.
Usually, when you're starting out, it's best to use as a library but larger
projects and larger installations will want to run their software components
independently, optimising for usage patterns, resilience, reliability and
rate of change.

Most people who use a terminology run a server and make calls over the network.

### How is this different to a national terminology service?

Previously, I implemented SNOMED CT within an EPR. 
Later I realised how important it was to build it as a separate module; 
I created terminology servers in java, and then later in golang; 
`hermes` is written in clojure. 
While I support the provision
of a national terminology server for convenience, I think it's important to
recognise that it is the *data* that matters most. We need to cooperate and collaborate
on semantic interoperability, but the software services that make use of those
data can be centralised or distributed; when I do analytics, I can't see me
making server round-trips for every check of subsumption! That would be 
silly; I've been using SNOMED for analytics for longer than most; you need
flexibility in provisioning terminology services. I want tooling that can both
provide services at scale, while is capable of running on my personal computers
as well.

Unlike other available terminology servers, `hermes` is lightweight and has no other dependencies 
except a filesystem, which can be read-only when in operation.

I don't believe in the idea of uploading codesystems and value sets in place. 
My approach to versioning is to run different services; I simply switch 
API endpoints. 

### Localisation

SNOMED CT is distributed across the world. The base distribution is the 
International release, but your local distribution will include this together
with local data. Local data will include region-specific language reference
sets.

The core SNOMED API relating to concepts and their meaning is not affected
by issues of locale. Locale is used to derive the synonyms for any given
concept. There should be a single preferred synonym for every concept in a 
given language reference set.

When you build a database, the search index caches the preferred synonym using
the locale specified during index creation. If no locale is specified, then
the system default locale will be used. In general, you should specify a 
locale that will match the distribution you are importing.

For example, when you are building your search index, you can use:
```shell
clj -M:run --db snomed.db --locale en-GB index  
```

You can specify the requested locale using IETF BCP 47, or by using a special
SNOMED CT defined locale that includes the identifier of the language reference 
set you wish to use. I have added BCP 47 matching as an extension in hermes
as the burden of managing which reference sets to use is left to the client
in the SNOMED standard. Hermes tries to provide a set of sane defaults.

Note: the mapping of BCP 47 codes to a language reference set, or set of 
language reference sets, is easily modified. If your locale is currently
unsupported, please raise an issue and it can be added easily. The current
map can be found in [impl/language.clj](src/com/eldrix/hermes/impl/language.clj).

Such mapping is simply an extension for convenience and may not be necessary for 
you. You can *always* get the preferred synonym given a specific set of language
reference sets but I find it easier to simply use 'en-GB' and let hermes do the
work for me.

### Can I get support?

Yes. Raise an issue, or more formal support options are available on request,
including a fully-managed service. 

### Why are you building so many small repositories?

Small modules of functionality are easier to develop, easier to understand,
easier to test and easier to maintain. I design modules to be composable so that I can
stitch different components together in order to solve problems.

In larger systems, it is easy to see code rotting. Dependencies become outdated and
the software becomes difficult to change easily because of software that depend
on it. Small, well-defined modules are much easier to build and are less likely
to need ongoing changes over time; my goal is to need to update modules only
in response to changes in *domain* not software itself. 
I aim for an accretion of functionality.

It is very difficult to 'prove' software is working as designed when there are
lots of moving parts.

### What are you using `hermes` for?

I have embedded it into clinical systems; I use it for a fast autocompletion
service so users start typing and the diagnosis, or procedure, or occupation,
or ethnicity, or whatever, pops up. Users don't generally know they're using
SNOMED CT. I use it to populate pop-ups and drop-down controls, and I use it
for decision support to switch functionality on and off in my user interface -
e.g. does this patient have a type of 'x' such as motor neurone disease - as well
as analytics. A large number of my academic publications are as a result of
using SNOMED in analytics.

### What is this graph stuff you're doing?

I think health and care data are and always will be heterogenous, incomplete and difficult to process. 
I do not think trying to build entities or classes representing our domain works at scale; it is
fine for toy applications and trivial data modelling such as e-observations, but classes and
object-orientation cannot scale across such a complete and disparate environment. Instead, I
find it much easier to think about first-class properties - entity - attribute - value - and
use such triples as a way of building and navigating a complex, hierarchical graph. 

I am using a graph API in order to decouple subsystems and can now navigate from clinical data
into different types of reference data seamlessly. For example, with the same backend data, I can view
an x.500 representation of a practitioner, or a FHIR R4 Practitioner resource model. 
The key is to recognise that identifier resolution and mapping are first class problems within
the health and care domain. Similarly, I think the semantics of reading data are very different to
one of writing data. I cannot shoehorn health and care data into a REST model in which we read and write
to resources representing the type. Instead, just as in real-life, we record event data which can effect change.
In the end, it is all data.

# Documentation

### A. How to download and build a terminology service

Ensure you have a pre-built jar file, or the source code checked out from github. See below for build instructions.

I'd recommend installing clojure and running using source code but use the pre-built jar file if you prefer.

#### 1. Download and install at least one distribution.

If your local distributor is supported, `hermes` can do this automatically for you. 
Otherwise, you will need to download your local distribution(s) manually.

##### i) Use a registered SNOMED CT distributor to automatically download and import

There is currently only support for automatic download and import for the UK,
but other distribution sources can be added if those services provide an API.

The basic command is:

```shell
clj -M:run --db snomed.db download <distribution-identifier> [properties] 
```

or if you are using a precompiled jar:
```shell
java -jar hermes.jar --db snomed.db download <distribution-identifier> [properties]
```

The distribution, as defined by `distribution-identifier`, will be downloaded
and imported to the file-based database `snomed.db`. 

| Distribution-identifier | Description                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------- |
| uk.nhs/sct-clinical     | UK SNOMED CT clinical - incl international release |
| uk.nhs/sct-drug-ext     | UK SNOMED CT drug extension - incl dm+d            |


Each distribution might require custom configuration options. These
can be given as key value pairs after the command, and their use will depend
on which distribution you are using.

For example, the UK releases use the NHS Digital TRUD API, and so you need to
pass in the following parameters:

- api-key   : path to a file containing your NHS Digital TRUD api key
- cache-dir : directory to use for downloading and caching releases 

For example, these commands will download, cache and install the International
release, the UK clinical edition and the UK drug extension:
```shell
clj -M:run --db snomed.db download uk.nhs/sct-clinical api-key trud-api-key.txt cache-dir /tmp/trud
clj -M:run --db snomed.db download uk.nhs/sct-drug-ext api-key trud-api-key.txt cache-dir /tmp/trud
```

`hermes` will tell you what configuration parameters are required:

```shell
clj -M:run download uk.nhs/sct-drug-ext
```
Will result in:
```
Invalid parameters for provider ' uk.nhs/sct-drug-ext ':

should contain keys: :api-key, :cache-dir

| key        | spec    |
|============+=========|
| :api-key   | string? |
|------------+---------|
| :cache-dir | string? |

```
So we know we need to pass in `api-key` and `cache-dir` as above.

##### ii) Download and install SNOMED CT distribution file(s) manually

Depending on where you live in the World, download the most appropriate
distribution(s) for your needs.

In the UK, we can obtain these from [TRUD](ttps://isd.digital.nhs.uk).

For example, you can download the UK "Clinical Edition", containing the International and UK clinical distributions 
as part of TRUD pack 26/subpack 101.

* [https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud3/user/authenticated/group/0/pack/26/subpack/101/releases](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud3/user/authenticated/group/0/pack/26/subpack/101/releases)

Optionally, you can also download the UK SNOMED CT drug extension, that contains the dictionary of medicines and devices (dm+d) is available
as part of TRUD pack 26/subpack 105.

* [https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud3/user/authenticated/group/0/pack/26/subpack/105/releases](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud3/user/authenticated/group/0/pack/26/subpack/105/releases)

Once you have downloaded what you need, unzip them to a common directory and 
then you can use `hermes` to create a file-based database. 

If you are running using the jar file:

```shell
java -jar hermes.jar --db snomed.db import ~/Downloads/snomed-2020
```

If you are running from source code:

```shell
clj -M:run --db snomed.db import ~/Downloads/snomed-2020/
```

The import of both International and UK distribution files takes
a total of less than 3 minutes on my machine.

#### 2. Compact database (optional).

This reduces the file size by around 20% and takes about 1 minute.
This is an optional step, but recommended.

```shell
java -jar hermes.jar --db snomed.db compact
```

or

```shell
clj -M:run --db snomed.db compact
```

You may need to give java more memory for compaction; I only need to do so after 
importing three different distributions, but it will depend on the size of each.

For example
```shell
java -Xmx8g -jar hermes.jar --db snomed.db compact
```

```shell 
clj -J-Xmx8g -M:run --db snomed.db compact
```

#### 3. Build search index

Run 
```shell
java -jar hermes.jar --db snomed.db index
```

or

```shell
clj -M:run --db snomed.db index
```
This will build the search index; it takes about 2 minutes on my machine.

#### 4. Run a REPL (optional)

When I first built terminology tools, either in java or in golang, I needed to
also build a custom command-line interface in order to explore the ontology.
This is not necessary as most developers using Clojure quickly learn the value
of the REPL; a read-evaluate-print-loop in which one can issue arbitrary 
commands to execute. As such, one has a full Turing-complete language (a lisp)
in which to explore the domain. 

Run a REPL and use the terminology services interactively. I usually use a 
REPL from within my IDE.

```
clj -A:dev
```
#### 5. Get the status of your installed index

You can obtain status information about any index by using:

```shell
clj -M:run --db snomed.db status
```

Result:

```shell
{:installed-releases
 ("SNOMED Clinical Terms version: 20200731 [R] (July 2020 Release)"
  "31.3.0_20210120000001 UK clinical extension"),
 :concepts 574414,
 :descriptions 1720404,
 :relationships 3263996,
 :refsets 9424174,
 :indices
 {:descriptions-concept 1720404,
  :concept-parent-relationships 1210561,
  :concept-child-relationships 1210561,
  :installed-refsets 293,
  :component-refsets 6094742,
  :map-target-component 1125516}}
```

The result will be different after I also import the UK dm+d 
(dictionary of medicines and devices) distribution.

#### 6. Run a terminology web service

By default, data are returned using [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) but
of course, simply add "Accept:application/json" in the request header and it
will return JSON instead. You can see examples below. 

```
java -jar hermes.jar --db snomed.db --port 8080 serve 
```

or
```
clj -M:run --db snomed.db --port 8080 serve
```

If you omit the serve command, or specify --help, `hermes` will show help text:

```shell
Usage: hermes [options] command [parameters]

Options:
  -p, --port PORT                       8080  Port number
  -a, --bind-address BIND_ADDRESS             Address to bind
      --allowed-origins "*" or ORIGINS        Set CORS policy, with "*" or comma-delimited hostnames
  -d, --db PATH                               Path to database directory
      --locale LOCALE                         Locale to use, if different from system
  -v, --verbose
  -h, --help

Commands:
 import [paths]             Import SNOMED distribution files
 list [paths]               List importable files
 download [provider] [opts] Download & install distribution from provider
 index                      Build search index.
 compact                    Compact database
 serve                      Start a terminology server
 status                     Displays status information
```

* --bind-address is optional. You may want to use --bind-address 0.0.0.0
* --allowed-origins is optional. You could use --allowed-origins "*" or --allowed-origins example.com,example.net
* --locale sets the default locale. This is used in building your search index and as a default if clients do not specify their preference


Example usage of search endpoint. 

```shell
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/snomed/search?s=mnd\&constraint=<64572001&maxHits=5" -H "Accept: application/json"  | jq
````

```shell.
[
  {
    "id": 486696014,
    "conceptId": 37340000,
    "term": "MND - Motor neurone disease",
    "preferredTerm": "Motor neuron disease"
  }
]

```

Here I use the [httpie](https://httpie.io/) command-line tool:

```shell
http -j localhost:8080/v1/snomed/concepts/24700007/extended
```

The result is an extended concept definition - all the information
needed for inference, logic and display. For example, at the client
level, we can then check whether this is a type of demyelinating disease
or is a disease affecting the central nervous system without further
server round-trips. Each relationship also includes the transitive closure tables for that
relationship, making it easier to execute logical inference.
Note how the list of descriptions includes a convenient
`acceptableIn` and `preferredIn` so you can easily display the preferred
term for your locale. If you provide an Accept-Language header, then 
you will also get a preferredDescription that is the best choice for those
language preferences given what is installed.

```shell

Here we use the expression constraint language to search for a term "mnd" 
ensuring we only receive results that are a type of 'Disease' ("<64572001")

```shell
http -j 'localhost:8080/v1/snomed/search?s=mnd\&constraint=<64572001'
```

Results:

```
http -j 'localhost:8080/v1/snomed/search?s=mnd\&constraint=<64572001'
[
    {
        "conceptId": 37340000,
        "id": 486696014,
        "preferredTerm": "Motor neuron disease",
        "term": "MND - Motor neurone disease"
    }
]

```

More complex expressions are supported, and no search term is actually needed.

Let's get all drugs with exactly three active ingredients:

```shell
http -j 'localhost:8080/v1/snomed/search?constraint=<373873005|Pharmaceutical / biologic product| : [3..3]  127489000 |Has active ingredient|  = <  105590001 |Substance|'
```

Or, what about all disorders of the lung that are associated with oedema?
```shell
http -j 'localhost:8080/v1/snomed/search?constraint= <  19829001 |Disorder of lung|  AND <  301867009 |Edema of trunk|'
```

The ECL can be written in a more concise fashion:

```shell
http -j 'localhost:8080/v1/snomed/search?constraint= <19829001 AND <301867009'
```


There are endpoints for crossmapping to and from SNOMED.

Let's map one of our diagnostic terms into ICD-10:

- `24700007` is multiple sclerosis.
- `999002271000000101` is the ICD-10 UK complex map reference set.

```shell
http -j localhost:8080/v1/snomed/concepts/24700007/map/999002271000000101
```

Result:

```
[
    {
        "active": true,
        "correlationId": 447561005,
        "effectiveTime": "2020-08-05",
        "id": "57433204-2371-5c6f-855f-94ff9dad7ba6",
        "mapAdvice": "ALWAYS G35.X",
        "mapCategoryId": 1,
        "mapGroup": 1,
        "mapPriority": 1,
        "mapRule": "",
        "mapTarget": "G35X",
        "moduleId": 999000031000000106,
        "referencedComponentId": 24700007,
        "refsetId": 999002271000000101
    }
]
```

And of course, we can crossmap back to SNOMED as well:
```shell
http -j localhost:8080/v1/snomed/crossmap/999002271000000101/G35X
```

If you map a concept into a reference set that doesn't contain that concept, you'll
automatically get the best parent matches instead.

Here we have multiple sclerosis (`24700007`), and we're mapping into the UK emergency unit
reference set (`991411000000109`):

```shell
http -j localhost:8080/v1/snomed/concepts/24700007/map/991411000000109
```

As multiple sclerosis in that reference set, you'll simply get:

```json
[
    {
        "active": true,
        "effectiveTime": "2015-10-01",
        "id": "d55ce305-3dcc-5723-8814-cd26486c37f7",
        "moduleId": 999000021000000109,
        "referencedComponentId": 24700007,
        "refsetId": 991411000000109
    }
]
```

But what happens if we try something that isn't in that emergency reference set?

Here is 'limbic encephalitis with LGI1 antibodies' (`763794005`). It isn't in
that UK emergency unit reference set:


```shell
http -j localhost:8080/v1/snomed/concepts/763794005/map/991411000000109
```
Result:
```json
[
    {
        "active": true,
        "effectiveTime": "2015-10-01",
        "id": "5b3b8cdd-dd02-50e3-b207-bf4a3aa17694",
        "moduleId": 999000021000000109,
        "referencedComponentId": 45170000,
        "refsetId": 991411000000109
    }
]
```

You get a more general concept - 'encephalitis' (`45170000`) that is in the
emergency unit reference set. This makes it straightforward to map concepts
into subsets of terms as defined by a reference set for analytics.

#### 7. Embed into another application

You can use git coordinates in a deps.edn file, or use maven: 

In your `deps.edn` file (make sure you change the commit-id):
```
[com.eldrix.hermes {:git/url "https://github.com/wardle/hermes.git"
                    :sha     "097e3094070587dc9362ca4564401a924bea952c"}
``` 

In your pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.eldrix</groupId>
  <artifactId>hermes</artifactId>
  <version>0.8.340</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, build a library jar (see below)

### B. How to use a running service in your own applications

The terminology server can be embedded into your own applications or, more
commonly, you would use as a standalone web service. Further documentation
will follow.

### C. How to build from source code

#### Run compilation checks (optional)

```
clj -M:check
```

#### Run unit tests and linters (optional)

```
clj -M:test
clj -X:test/cloverage
clj -M:lint/kondo
clj -M:lint/eastwood
```

#### View outdated dependencies

```
clj -M:outdated
```

You can view a complete list of dependencies; try:

```
clj -X:deps tree
```

#### Building uberjar

Build the uberjar:
```shell
clojure -T:build uber
```

#### Building library jar

A library jar contains only hermes-code, and none of the bundled dependencies.  

```shell
clojure -T:build jar
```

Or you can install hermes into your local maven repository:

```shell
clojure -T:build install
```
