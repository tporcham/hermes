This log documents significant changes for each release.

## Not yet released

* Much more complete automated testing using synthetic data

## [0.9.369] - 2022-02-17

* Bump to Lucene 9.0 - hermes now requires JDK 11 or newer.
* Switch to using clojure.data.json for JSON export.
* Bump other minor outdated dependencies (logback, trud).

## [0.9.362] - 2022-02-15

* Support for mapping concepts into a defined subset of concepts.
* Add get-synonyms convenience function
* Expose get-all-children at top-level API

## [0.8.341] - 2022-01-22

* Bump to Apache Lucene 8.11.0 - no API or index changes, but simply bug fixes
* Add --allowed-origins option to server to enable configuration of CORS, if required
* Add build via [tools.build](https://github.com/clojure/tools.build)
* Add deployment to clojars.

## [0.8.3] - 2021-11-04

* More complete UK language refset priority list
* Fail fast if there are any issues caught during processing (e.g. broken data such as invalid dates)
* Optimisations to import, parsing and storage flow. Better handling of errors during import.
* Fixed import of simple reference sets, including when 'Simple' not in summary field of filename
* Tidied status output when importing data if no metadata found.

## [0.8.2] - 2021-10-31

* status command now prints installed reference sets, and optionally counts of SNOMED data

## [0.8.1] - 2021-10-30

* Add explicit choice of locale at time of index creation for preferred concept cache. Hermes supports multiple languages but for convenience caches the preferred synonym for a given locale (or set of reference sets) in the search index.

* Permit configuration of with-historical to allow choice of association refset types
* Add ECL membership check
* Add reverse cross-map prefix search (useful for ICD-10 and Read)
* Optimisations

## [0.7.5] - 2021-09-13

* Fixed handling of '<<' in expressions.

## [0.7.0] - 2021-05-31

* New graph API using declarative approach permitting clients to ask for exactly what they need

* Restructuring - separate library code from cli commands / server
* Add rudimentary github actions tests, but not yet using live db
* Add historical associations reference set support
* Update database version to v0.6 given new indexes.
* Better query re-writing for when single must-not clauses used alone. 

## [0.6.2] - 2021-04-20

* Harmonise web service key names to use camel case and not mix in kebab-case.
* Expose library API call to get installed reference sets
* Expose support for 'Accept-Language' using BCP 47 language tags in REST server, with additional support for specific language reference set extension of form en-gb-x-XXXX where XXXX is preferred language refset.
